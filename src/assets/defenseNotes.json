      "body": "When the examiners ask question, do not assume they're raising questions just to attack you. Instead, think that they're asking questions because they want to deeply understand and appreciate what you've done. So, take questions kindly.<br /><br />If that doesn't work for you, think of examiners as your employers who have paid you a ton of money to develop a system for them. So, they have  every right to ask any questions and even be upset. So, try to see things in their shoe (your employers) and stay calm whenever they talk to you harshly and answer their question kindly."
